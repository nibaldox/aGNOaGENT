"""ðŸŽ¬ Agent with Structured Output - Your AI Movie Script Generator

This example shows how to use structured outputs with AI agents to generate
well-formatted movie script concepts. It shows two approaches:
1. JSON Mode: Traditional JSON response parsing
2. Structured Output: Enhanced structured data handling

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
