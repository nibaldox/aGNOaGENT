Okay, the user is asking for a comprehensive financial news report on GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and IBM's cloud divisions, focusing on product launches, partnerships, and regulatory issues from the last 3 months. They want sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, or official blogs. 

First, I need to check if the previous attempts to get this information were successful. The user mentioned that the function calls to search_google didn't return any results. Maybe the search query wasn't specific enough or the parameters were incorrect. Let me think about the parameters. The function requires a query and num_results. The user specified the last 3 months, so the date filter should be set to 2022-05-28 (current date is 2025-05-28, but the task says last 3 months, so maybe 2022-05-28 is a mistake? Wait, the current date in the instructions is 2025-05-28, so three months prior would be 2025-02-28. But the user might have intended the search to be within the last 3 months up to now. However, the function might not support date ranges in the query. Maybe the user is using an older system where the date is fixed. Alternatively, maybe the search terms need to be more precise. The user wants product launches, partnerships, regulatory issues. So the query should include those keywords. Let me try structuring the query as "recent product launches, partnerships, regulatory issues GOOGL AMZN MSFT IBM cloud 2025" but that might be too broad. Alternatively, use specific terms like "GOOGL cloud launch", "AMZN partnership", "MSFT regulatory update", "IBM cloud product". 

Wait, the user's task says to search for the last 3 months. But the current date is 2025-05-28, so three months prior would be 2025-02-28. However, the function might not allow date parameters, so maybe the user is using a different method. Alternatively, the previous attempts might have failed because the search function didn't return results. Maybe the search terms need to be adjusted. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is not working correctly, and the search_results are empty. In that case, I need to inform the user that no results were found. But the user expects a list of articles. Since the function isn't returning any results, perhaps there's an error in the tool or the query. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing the system, and the function is not functioning as expected. In that case, I should respond that no relevant articles were found in the last 3 months for the specified companies. However, the user might have expected some results. 

But given the previous attempts, the function is not returning any search results. So the answer would be that no articles were found. However, the user might have intended for the assistant to proceed without the function. But according to the instructions, the assistant should use the function. Since the function isn't working, the assistant has to state that no results were found. 

Therefore, the final answer would be that no relevant articles were found in the last 3 months for the specified companies and their cloud divisions. The assistant would list that as the conclusion.

After multiple attempts to retrieve recent news articles about product launches, partnerships, or regulatory issues involving GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, and IBM's cloud divisions, no relevant results were found in the last 3 months. This could indicate either limited public updates in this timeframe or limitations in the search tool's ability to retrieve recent data. 

For the latest information, consider checking official company blogs, Bloomberg, Reuters, or TechCrunch directly for updates. 

**Summary**: No actionable news articles were identified for the specified criteria within the requested timeframe.
